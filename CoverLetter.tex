		\opening{To whom it may concern:} 
		
		%PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which you learned of the opening (i.e. career development center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).
		
		I'm writing to apply for the position of Software Engineer at the Holland Computing Center at UNL. I am confident that my skills are well-aligned with this position, and that I would be an excellent fit for the university.
		
		%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 
		
		As the current software engineer in this position, I have fulfilled all of the job requirements.  I have been involved in the purchases of clusters as well as the management of graduate and undergraduate students.  I have used and modified software such as HTCondor and CVMFS to optimize for various distributed workflows.  Furthermore, my dissertation \textit{Enabling Distributed Scientific Computing on the Campus} described possible future directions of distributed computing on a campus such as UNL.  These data-driven workflows described in my dissertation are becoming more commonly used by researchers.  Therefore, it is important to continue research into easier-to-use methods to enable researchers to run these workflows.
		
		%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 
		
		My experience and work ethic makes me an excellent fit for the position of Software Engineer.  I have enclosed my resume for your consideration.  Please feel free to contact me via phone or email at a time of your convenience to discuss my qualifications, as well as the job requirements for this position. I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you. Thank you.
		
		\closing{Sincerely yours,}
